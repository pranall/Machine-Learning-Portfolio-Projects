# Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Projects
Hello! This repository contains all the projects I did in Machine Learning.

Part A: Linear Models: Project focuses on linear and multiple regression analysis using the Auto.csv dataset. The project includes simulations, model fitting, visualization, and interpretation of results for both simple and multiple linear regression scenarios.
