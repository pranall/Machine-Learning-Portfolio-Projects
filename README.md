# Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Projects
Hello! This repository contains all the projects I did in Machine Learning.

----------
Linear Models: Project focuses on linear and multiple regression analysis using the Auto.csv dataset. The project includes simulations, model fitting, visualization, and interpretation of results for both simple and multiple linear regression scenarios.

-----------------

Resampling Methods: Project focuses on resampling methods and regression modeling using the data.csv dataset and also demonstrates the application of bootstrap, cross-validation, and regularized regression techniques to estimate model parameters and evaluate predictive performance.

-------------

Non-Linear Regression Models: Project focused on non-linear regression modeling using the college.csv and regression.csv datasets. The project demonstrates the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Poisson GAMs to capture non-linear and interaction effects in data.

Classification: Project focuses on classification methods using the Weekly and Auto.csv datasets and also demonstrates the application of logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and other classification approaches to predict categorical outcomes based on predictor variables.

Tree Based Models: Project focuses on tree-based methods using datasets from the ISLR repository and also demonstrates the use of random forests and boosting to model complex relationships and evaluate predictive performance compared to simpler models.

Loan Default Prediction Project: This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical data.
